# Weather Dashboard

This is a simple web application that allows users to check the current weather and forecast for multiple cities. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data.

- Motivation

The motivation behind this project was to create a user-friendly tool that provides accurate and up-to-date weather information. This application aims to help users plan their activities based on the current weather and forecast of their chosen city.

- Why This Was Built

This application was built to provide a practical solution for those who need quick and reliable weather updates. It was also built as a way to explore and understand how to work with APIs, specifically the OpenWeatherMap API.

- What It Solved

This application solves the problem of having to search through multiple sources to get comprehensive weather data. It provides current weather conditions and a 5-day forecast all in one place, making it a convenient tool for users.

- What I Learned

Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of how to use APIs in web development. I also learned how to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript and how to style a web application using CSS.
